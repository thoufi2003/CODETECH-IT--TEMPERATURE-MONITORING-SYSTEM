DURATION :  FEBRUARY 5th, 2025 to MARCH 5th, 2025 (4 WEEKS)

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

OVERVIEW : TEMPERATURE-MONITORING-SYSTEM
This project is a temperature and humidity monitoring system that uses an LCD display, DHT11 sensor, buzzer, and LED to indicate high-temperature conditions. The system continuously monitors temperature and humidity, displaying the values on an LCD screen while activating an LED and buzzer if the temperature exceeds a threshold (30°C).

### **Objectives:**
 Monitor temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor. Display real-time readings on an I2C LCD. Provide alerts through a buzzer and LED when the temperature exceeds a predefined limit.Improve safety by offering a visual and audio alert for high-temperature conditions.


### **Key Components:***
1. Arduino Uno / Any Compatible Microcontroller – Controls all components.
2. DHT11 Sensor – Measures temperature and humidity.
3. I2C LCD Display (16x2) – Shows temperature and humidity values.
4. Buzzer (Pin 8) – Sounds an alarm when temperature exceeds 30°C.
5. LED (Pin 7) – Provides a visual indication for high temperature.
6. Power Supply (5V DC) – Powers the system.

   
### **Technology Used:**
1. Embedded Systems – Microcontroller-based automation.
2. I2C Communication – Used for interfacing the LCD with the microcontroller.
3. Digital Sensors – DHT11 for temperature and humidity detection.
4. Actuators – LED and buzzer for alerts.
5. Serial Communication – Debugging via Serial Monitor.

**Applications**
. Industrial Safety – Detects overheating in factories or electrical rooms.
. Home Automation – Monitors indoor climate conditions.
. Greenhouse Monitoring – Ensures optimal temperature for plant growth.
. Server Room Monitoring – Alerts when temperature crosses safe limits.

**SIMULATION OUTPUT**
